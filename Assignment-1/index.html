      <li class="unordered-list">
        Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1

      <li class="unordered-list">
        Internal - by using style element in the head section
      </li>
      <li class="unordered-list">
        External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.
      </li>

        <span id="text-1"
          >The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS
          files. However,</span

          >In this tutorial we will use Inline and Internal styles,
        </span>
        <span id="text-3"
          >because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it

    <p class="para-1">
      When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a
      style to multiple elements.ID, on the other hand applies a style to one
      unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to
      link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p class="para-1">
      In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element on a web page.
      Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied
      to the element.
    </p>
    <p class="para-1">
      There is wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used
      are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should
      be applied.
